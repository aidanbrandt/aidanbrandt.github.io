						<h1>Aidan Brandt</h1>					
						<p> I'm the founder of a non-profit organization called the Displacement Data Project, which processes and stores data on forced migration around the world. I'm also a student at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where I pursue an M.A. in International Relations and Economics. I'm especially interested in statebuilding economics and defence policy. If you're looking for my PGP public key, <a href="http://www.aidanbrandt.com/pgp.txt">look here.</a></p>
